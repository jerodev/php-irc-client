## Client

The client is the heart of the library, this object is used to perform all communication between your application and the IRC server. It will manage the connection to the IRC server and has all functions needed to interact with the server.

    use Jerodev\PhpIrcClient\IrcClient;

    $client = new IrcClient('irc.server:6667', 'Jerodev');
    $client->connect();

## Events

The `on()` function on the client can be used to register to several different events. This can be done both before and after connecting to the IRC server. Events have variable callback arguments, all are described below.

### <a name="client-event-registered"></a> Registered on server

    $client->on('registered', function () { });

Emitted when the server sends the initial welcome message (`001`). This indicates that you are connected to the server.

    $client->on('motd', function (string $motd) { });

Emitted when the server sends the message of the day to the client. If the message of the day is multiple lines, this event might be emitted multiple times.
